**Design of Flask Application to Fetch and Display Top 20 News Articles for a Given Date**

---

**HTML Files:**

1. **index.html**: This HTML file serves as the homepage of the application. It presents a user-friendly interface that consists of:
   - A title or header introducing the purpose of the application.
   - A date picker input field for the user to select a date for fetching the news articles.
   - A submit button that triggers the Flask application to fetch and display the news articles for the selected date.

2. **news.html**: This HTML file is responsible for displaying the fetched news articles. It includes:
   - A heading or title indicating the date for which the news articles are being displayed.
   - A list of the top 20 news articles for the specified date, with each article including a title, a short description, and a link to the full article on the original news website.

**Routes:**

1. **Home Route (/)**: This route handles the display of the homepage (index.html). When a user accesses the application's root URL (i.e., http://localhost:5000/), this route is triggered, and the index.html file is rendered.

2. **Fetch News Route (/fetch_news)**: This route is responsible for fetching the top 20 news articles for a given date. It accepts a date as a parameter and performs the following tasks:
   - Calls a suitable news API or web scraping tool to fetch the news articles for the specified date.
   - Stores the fetched news articles in a temporary data structure or database (not part of the Flask design).
   - Redirects the user to the news.html file, passing the fetched news articles as a variable.

3. **Display News Route (/news)**: This route handles the rendering of the news.html file. It receives the fetched news articles from the Fetch News route and displays them in a user-friendly format, as described in the news.html section.

**Additional Notes:**

- The application should incorporate error handling for scenarios such as invalid date inputs or API/web scraping failures.
- The design assumes a basic understanding of HTML and Jinja2 templating for the HTML files.
- The specific implementation details, including the API/web scraping tool selection and data storage mechanism, are left to the developer's discretion.
